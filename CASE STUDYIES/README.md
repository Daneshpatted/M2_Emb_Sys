# CASE STUDY-1 (low level application)


 

BLOCK- DAIGRAM

## EXPLANATION:
1) Load Cell → 
-	It is essentially force sensor or force transducer.
-	 It is used principally to measure weight.
-	 It converts a load or force acting on it into an electronic signal. 
-	When load, force or stress is applied to the sensor. It changes its resistance.
-	This change in resistance leads to a change in output voltage when a input voltage is applied.

2) Signal Amplifier→
-	Load cell output signal is very weak.
-	So it’s required for this signal to amplified up to convertible range to convert analog to digital signal.

3)	ADC→
-	Microcontroller can’t understand analog signal directly so use ADC.
-	Amplified signal filter to avoiding damping signals for constant and accurate reading. 
-	Analog to digital converter resolution define final scale resolution, so ADC resolution must be high.

4)	Microcontroller→
-	Digital signal received by microcontroller and process it after processing signal it’s provide final output of weight in digital display.

5) Display & Memory→
-	LCD display received signal by microcontroller and process it after processing signal it’s provide final output of weight in LCD display.
-	This is a nonvolatile memory that is often used to store system configuration parameters for an microcontroller application.

6) Power supply→
-	Power supply unit provide to all section of main control unit of microcontroller, display unit, amplifier and ADC.
-	Power supply unit is very important just like food for all electronics circuit.
-	If power is best filtered and regulated then working more effectively and life of circuits is improve.
