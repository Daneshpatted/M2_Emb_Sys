  ## ABSTRACT 
  
 Automatic Smart car parking project aims at providing a confusion free and easy parking. This concept
helps the drivers of the cars to park their vehicles with minimum wastage of time with accurate information of 
the availability of the space to park vehicle.Everything in the modern world is moving automatic system,
we have built a system like that which can automatically sense the entry 
and exit of cars through the gate and then display the number of cars in the parking lot. 
This automated car parking system reduce the time taken to check the space for the 
vehicle by displaying the available space for parking on a LCD displayer.
This project is developed using micro-controller arduino uno. 
      
  ## 1. INTRODUCTION
  
  An automated parking system is a area or volume required for parking cars. 
  Automated Parking System provides parking for cars on multiple levels stacked 
  vertically to maximize the number of parking spaces while minimizing land usage.
    so we have deployed a microcontroller which is used to sense the movement
of cars and it either Free space is there or not. It is possible to free
space when any car enters in the parking lot or close the gate when
a car exits from the parking lot. The sensing of entry and exit of
cars is done with the help of IR transmitters and receivers.
 This change in output is sensed by the microcontroller and
accordingly it increments and decrement the count and opens the gate if there is
space. The procedure for the exit of the cars is similar as
the entry
